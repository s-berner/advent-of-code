# Advent of Code Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for the Advent of Code challenges. Advent of Code is an annual coding event where a new programming puzzle is released every day in December.

## Structure

Each day's challenge has its own folder, named `Day01`, `Day02`, and so on. Inside each day's folder, you'll find the solutions for both tasks labeled as `Task1` and `Task2`.

## Getting Started

To run the solutions and get the answers, you'll need a C# development environment set up on your machine. Here are the steps to run the solutions:

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/s-berner/advent-of-code-solutions.git
```

2. Navigate to the repository directory:
```
cd advent-of-code-solutions
```

3. Build and run the solutions using .NET CLI:
```
dotnet run -- <Day> <Task> <Mode>
```

- Replace `<Day>` with the day number (e.g., 01, 02).
- Replace `<Task>` with the task number (1 or 2).
- Replace `<Mode>` with either "D" for Demo or "P" for Puzzle to specify the input mode.

For example, to run Day 1, Task 1 in Puzzle mode:
```
dotnet run -- 01 1 P
```

4. The solution output and result will be displayed in the console.
